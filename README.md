# Financial_ratio_analyzer

This project is a Financial Ratio Analyzer that automates the calculation of key financial ratios such as profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios using Python and Excel. The raw financial data is entered in Excel, and a Python script processes it to generate ratios in a separate sheet. The Excel charts are linked to these ratios so that when the data is updated, the visualizations update automatically.
